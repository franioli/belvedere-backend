"""DDL for the Postgres views and triggers owned by the `surveys` app.

Kept here rather than inside a migration because more than one migration needs
it: any change to `measurements.geom` forces the dependent views to be dropped
and recreated, so the definitions must come from one place.

The view bodies are the ones adopted in `surveys/migrations/0011_adopt_views.py`,
which keeps its own copy as the record of what was originally applied.

**Any change to a view must go through a new migration** — never manual DDL.
