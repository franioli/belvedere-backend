"""Merge points whose labels differ only by case or surrounding whitespace.

A CSV import that looks points up by exact label creates `D01BIS` alongside an
existing `D01bis`, splitting a stake's history in two. The damage is not just
untidy: `points_movement_raw` partitions by label, so the orphaned campaign
gets `dt = 0` and no displacement at all.

Dry-run by default; `--apply` is required to write anything.
